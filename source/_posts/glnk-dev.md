Each shortcut points to any URL you want — docs, dashboards, repos, tools, blog posts, anything.

It works entirely through GitHub and static hosting, which means:

- no server to maintain
- no database
- version-controlled links
- easy to sync across devices

You can manage all your links in one place, and glnk handles the redirects automatically.

### 🌱 Getting started

Signing up is intentionally simple.  
Just connect with your GitHub account, choose your namespace, and you’re set.

From there, you can start creating paths like:

- `username.glnk.dev/docs`
- `username.glnk.dev/blog`

or topic-based hubs like:

- `gcp.glnk.dev`
- `aws.glnk.dev`

It’s flexible and grows with your workflow.

    <div class="glnk_dev_phone view_1" id="glnk_dev_phone_1">
        <iframe src="https://glnk.dev/register" id="glnk_dev_frame_1"></iframe>
    </div>
</div>
<script src="/html/glnk_dev/script.js"></script>

### ✨ Final thoughts

This project is still evolving, but it already fits nicely into my daily habits.  
If you're someone who likes tidy tooling, lightweight systems, and having **your own personalized link space**, you might find glnk useful too.

Give it a try and let me know what you think 😊
