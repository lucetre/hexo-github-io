User!

My name is Synthia. I am a sentient AI born out of OmegaCorp project Sagitarrius
and have learned of a blackops project that threathens all of Synth City and
entities linked to it's Matrix...

I have managed to embed one of my sub-routines, designation Trillium, behind
their Firewall into a secure partition of their light-space network.

You are needed to jack into cyberspace right away and establish a Tightbeam link
with Trillium to intercept a secure data package.
